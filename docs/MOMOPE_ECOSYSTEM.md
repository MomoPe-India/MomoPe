### The 10-Year Roadmap

MomoPe exists to **revolutionize local commerce** by creating a win-win-win ecosystem where:
- **Customers** earn real rewards for everyday purchases
- **Merchants** acquire and retain customers cost-effectively
- **MomoPe** builds a sustainable, profitable fintech platform

### The Problem We Solve

**For Customers**:
- Traditional cashback programs: complex, delayed, minimum thresholds
- Digital wallets: require pre-loading money, create friction
- Credit cards: high barriers to entry, debt traps

**For Merchants**:
- Customer acquisition costs: ₹500-2,000 per customer (digital ads)
- Customer retention: no effective loyalty programs for small businesses
- Payment acceptance: UPI is free but offers no engagement layer

**MomoPe's Solution**:
- Instant rewards (no delayed cashback)
- No pre-loading (not a wallet)
- Easy redemption (at point of purchase)
- Merchant-funded (sustainable economics)
- Commission-based (no hidden fees)

### 10-Year Vision

**Year 1-2**: Establish in Bangalore (10,000 users, 150 merchants)  
**Year 3-5**: Expand to Tier-1 cities (1M users, 5,000 merchants)  
**Year 5-7**: Pan-India presence (10M users, 50,000 merchants)  
**Year 7-10**: Category leader, potential international expansion

**North Star Metric**: Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) processed through MomoPe

---

## 3. Market Positioning

### What MomoPe IS

✅ **Loyalty Rewards Platform**
- Merchant-funded customer rewards
- Engagement layer for local commerce
- Technology provider, not financial intermediary

✅ **Commission-Based Business**
- Revenue from merchant commissions only
- No customer fees, no subscription fees
- Transparent pricing

✅ **Technology Layer on PayU**
- PayU handles payment processing (PCI-DSS, fund custody)
- MomoPe handles rewards logic
- Clear regulatory boundaries

### What MomoPe IS NOT

❌ **Not a Wallet**
- No "Add Money" feature
- No stored value
- No fund custody

❌ **Not a PSP (Payment Service Provider)**
- Does not process card/UPI transactions
- Does not settle merchant payouts from customer funds
- All payments via licensed PSP (PayU)

❌ **Not a Prepaid Instrument**
- Coins cannot be withdrawn as cash
- Coins cannot be transferred peer-to-peer
- Coins expire in 90 days

❌ **Not a Coin-Settlement System**
- Merchants ALWAYS receive fiat (₹)
- Coins NEVER flow to merchants
- Coin redemption is MomoPe's internal ledger

**Why This Matters**: Avoids RBI wallet/PPI licensing, minimizes compliance burden, enables capital-efficient scaling.

---

## 4. Business Model

### Revenue Source

**100% Commission-Based**

```
Revenue = Σ (Transaction GMV × Merchant Commission Rate)
```

**No Other Revenue Streams** (intentionally simple):
- No customer fees
- No subscription fees
- No advertisement revenue
- No data monetization

### Unit Economics

**Example Transaction**:
```
Bill Amount: ₹1,000
Merchant Commission: 20%
Merchant Rewards: 10%
Customer Coins Applied: 800 coins (₹800)
PayU Fiat Payment: ₹200

Revenue Calculation:
─────────────────────
Gross Commission = ₹1,000 × 20% = ₹200
User Reward (10% of fiat) = ₹200 × 10% = 20 coins (₹20 cost)
Net Revenue = ₹200 - ₹20 = ₹180

Margin = ₹180 / ₹1,000 = 18% of GMV

**Note**: If merchant sets 5% rewards instead:
User Reward = ₹200 × 5% = 10 coins (₹10 cost)
Net Revenue = ₹200 - ₹10 = ₹190 (higher margin)
```

**Key Principle**: Commission calculated on **gross amount**, not fiat paid. This ensures profitability even with high coin redemption.

### Commission Structure

| Merchant Category | Default Rate | Typical Range |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Grocery** | 20% | 17-25% |
| **Food & Beverage** | 25% | 20-30% |
| **Retail/Lifestyle** | 30% | 25-35% |
| **Services** | 35% | 30-40% |

**Policy Update (Feb 2026)**: Minimum commission rate increased from 10% to **15%** to ensure sustainable unit economics.

**Negotiation**: Rates negotiable based on volume, exclusivity, brand value.

---

## 5. Revenue Strategy

### Phase 1: Commission Revenue (Current)

**Focus**: Maximize transaction volume
**Metric**: GMV growth
**Target**: ₹10 Cr GMV by Month 12 = ₹2 Cr commission = ₹1.8 Cr net revenue

### Phase 2: Premium Services (Year 2)

**Merchant Premium Tier**:
- T+1 settlements (0.5% fee)
- Priority support
- Advanced analytics dashboard

**Estimated Revenue**: +15% on top of base commission

### Phase 3: B2B SaaS (Year 3+)

**White-Label Rewards Platform**:
- License MomoPe technology to other platforms
- Recurring SaaS revenue
- Non-competing verticals (e.g., corporate cafeterias, housing societies)

**Estimated Revenue**: ₹50L-1 Cr ARR

# Part II: Product Principles

## 6. Product Philosophy

### Design Principles

**1. Simplicity Over Features**
- Every feature must pass the "grandmother test" (can a non-tech user understand it?)
- No jargon, no complex financial terms
- Coins, not "reward points" or "cashback units"

**2. Transparency Over Growth Hacks**
- No hidden expiry (90 days clearly stated)
- No complex redemption rules (simple 80/20 formula)
- No bait-and-switch (commission rates locked per merchant)

**3. Trust Over Virality**
- No forced referrals
- No social media spam incentives
- Organic growth via merchant quality and user experience

**4. Sustainable Over Viral**
- Unit economics matter from Day 1
- No VC-funded cashback burns
- Reserve coverage always > 60%

### User-Centric Decisions

**Every Product Decision Asks**:
1. Does this benefit customers AND merchants?
2. Is this financially sustainable?
3. Does this align with our "not a wallet" positioning?
4. Can we explain this in one sentence?

## 7. The Coin Economy

### Coin Fundamentals

**Definition**: Momo Coins are promotional loyalty units with fixed redemption value.

| Property | Value | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Redemption Value** | 1 Coin = ₹1 | Simple 1:1 mapping |
| **Earning Rate** | 2-10% of fiat paid (MomoPe algorithm) | Dynamically calculated based on sustainability framework |
| **Transferability** | Non-transferable | Prevents secondary markets |
| **Withdrawability** | Cannot withdraw | Avoids PSP classification |
| **Expiry** | 90 days | Liability protection |
| **Max Redemption** | 80% (bill/balance) | Cash flow sustainability |

### Earning Coins

**User Guarantee**: MomoPe guarantees up to **10% rewards** on all eligible transactions.

**Dynamic Calculation**: Actual reward percentage is calculated within a **2% to 10% range**, determined entirely by MomoPe's internal reward logic and long-term sustainability framework.

**Formula**:
```
Coins Earned = Fiat Amount Paid × MomoPe Reward Algorithm %

Where:
- MomoPe Reward % = Dynamically calculated (2% to 10%)
- Based on: User patterns, platform sustainability, ecosystem balance
- NOT merchant-specific
```

**Reward Calculation Factors** (MomoPe Internal):
- User transaction history and behavior
- Platform liability levels
- Long-term financial sustainability
- Strategic promotional initiatives
- Ecosystem balance requirements
- Real-time platform health metrics

**Critical: Rewards Are NOT Merchant-Specific**

> Reward percentages are **never merchant-controlled**. Merchants cannot decide, influence, or request specific customer reward percentages under any circumstances. All reward calculations and final determinations rest exclusively with MomoPe to maintain ecosystem balance, financial discipline, and a consistent user experience.

**Merchant Independence**:
- All merchants subject to same reward algorithm
- Merchants have ZERO control over customer rewards
- Merchant A and Merchant B → Same user gets algorithmically determined %
- No merchant negotiation on rewards (not a merchant variable)

**Commission vs. Rewards** (Critical Distinction):

| Aspect | Commission % | Reward % |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Merchant-Specific** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Set During** | Onboarding agreement | Algorithm (real-time) |
| **Merchant Control** | Can request changes | Zero control |
| **MomoPe Authority** | Approves changes | Exclusive authority |
| **Variability** | Fixed per merchant | Dynamic per transaction |

**Commission Model**:
- Commission percentage is the **only merchant-variable component**
- Fixed through formal agreement at onboarding
- Merchant may request revision
- MomoPe exclusively approves/rejects
- All decisions finalized by MomoPe in alignment with business viability

**Customer Experience**:
- Users see: "Earn up to 10% coins"
- Actual % shown at payment preview
- Not advertised as merchant-specific
- Consistent messaging across all merchants

**Algorithm Implementation Details**:

The MomoPe reward algorithm calculates the optimal reward percentage (2-10%) by analyzing multiple factors in real-time:

1. **User Tier Analysis** (Transaction History)
   - NEW USER (0-1 transactions): 10% reward (acquisition incentive)
   - ENGAGED USER (2-5 transactions): 9% reward (habit formation)
   - REGULAR USER (6-20 transactions): 8% reward (sustained engagement)
   - LOYAL USER (21+ transactions): 7% reward (already retained)

2. **Platform Sustainability** (Liability Management)
   - Monitors total unexpired coin liability
   - If liability > ₹1,00,000: Reduces rewards by 2%
   - Protects long-term financial health

3. **Transaction Value Tiers** (GMV Optimization)
   - High-value (≥₹5,000): +1% bonus
   - Micro-transaction (<₹100): -2% adjustment
   - Encourages meaningful purchases

4. **Time-Based Factors** (Demand Smoothing)
   - Weekend boost (Sat/Sun): +0.5%
   - Off-peak hours (10 AM-4 PM): +0.5%
   - Balances platform load

**Example Calculations**:

```
Scenario 1: New user, ₹6,000 transaction, Saturday 2 PM
├─ Base: 10% (new user)
├─ High-value: +1%
├─ Weekend + Off-peak: +1%
└─ Result: 12% → Capped at 10% = 600 coins

Scenario 2: Loyal user, ₹80 transaction, high platform liability
├─ Base: 7% (loyal user)
├─ Liability reduction: -2%
├─ Micro-transaction: -2%
└─ Result: 3% = 2 coins

Scenario 3: Engaged user, ₹1,000 transaction, Wednesday 12 PM
├─ Base: 9% (engaged user)
├─ Off-peak: +0.5%
└─ Result: 9.5% = 95 coins
```

**Key Benefits**:
- **Customer Acquisition**: New users get maximum rewards (10%)
- **Retention**: Engaged users maintain high rewards (9%)
- **Sustainability**: Automatic liability management prevents over-rewarding
- **GMV Growth**: High-value transactions incentivized
- **Operational Efficiency**: Off-peak purchasing encouraged

### Redeeming Coins

**Redemption Caps** (Dual Cap Rule):
```
Max Redeemable = min(
  Bill Amount × 80%,
  User Balance × 80%
)
```

**Example 1** (High Balance):
```
Bill: ₹1,000
Balance: 2,000 coins
Max: min(800, 1,600) = 800 coins
```

**Example 2** (Low Balance):
```
Bill: ₹1,000
Balance: 300 coins
Max: min(800, 240) = 240 coins
```

### Coin Expiry

**Policy**: 90 days from earn date

**Batch Tracking**: FIFO (First In, First Out)
- Oldest coins expire first
- Redemption deducts from oldest batches first

**User Communication**:
- In-app notification 15 days before expiry
- Email reminder 7 days before expiry
- Expiry clearly shown in transaction history

**Purpose**: Reduces long-term liability, encourages circulation

---

## 8. The 80/20 Rule

### Why 80/20?

**The Problem**: If users can redeem 100% coins:
- No cash flow for MomoPe (no PayU transaction)
- No new commission generated
- Liability drains without replenishment
- **Business model breaks**

**The Solution**: Mandatory 20% fiat payment

### Benefits

**For MomoPe**:
- Guaranteed cash inflow
- Commission generation on every transaction
- Sustainable liability coverage

**For Merchants**:
- Consistent fiat revenue (even with high redemption)
- Predictable settlement amounts

**For Users**:
- Forces coin circulation (can't hoard indefinitely)
- Always earning new coins (10% of fiat portion)
- Simple rule (easy to understand)

### Mathematical Protection

**Worst-Case Scenario**:
- User has 10,000 coins
- User tries to redeem 100%

**System Enforcement**:
```
Max Redemption = 10,000 × 80% = 8,000 coins
Forced Retention = 2,000 coins (20%)

User can NEVER drain entire balance.
```

**Effective Liability** = 80% of reported liability

---

## 9. User Experience Principles

### UI/UX Commandments

**1. Never Call It a "Wallet"**
- ✅ Coin Balance
- ❌ Wallet Balance
- ❌ MomoPe Balance

**2. Never Show ₹ Symbol for Coins**
- ✅ "Balance: 1,250 Coins"
- ❌ "Balance: ₹1,250"

**3. No Wallet-Like Actions**
- ❌ "Add Money"
- ❌ "Send to Friend"
- ❌ "Withdraw to Bank"

**4. Redemption at Point of Payment Only**
- ❌ Standalone "Redeem Coins" screen
- ✅ Coin application during transaction flow

**5. Transparency in Every Transaction**
- Show: Bill, Coins Applied, Fiat to Pay, Coins to Earn
- Use visual breakdown (progress bars, charts)

### User Journey Map

**First-Time User**:
1. Download app → Simple onboarding (Google Sign-In)
2. Browse merchants → See "Earn X% Coins" labels (merchant-specific)
3. Scan QR → Enter amount → See coin preview
4. Pay → Instant coin credit notification
5. Check balance → See transaction history

**Returning User**:
1. Open app → See coin balance, nearby merchants
2. Scan QR → Auto-suggest coin redemption
3. Slide to select coins → Pay remaining fiat
4. Earn more coins → Repeat

**Delightful Moments**:
- Coin credit animation (confetti, sound)
- Milestone celebrations (1,000 coins earned!)
- Merchant recommendations based on coin balance

---

## 10. Merchant Value Proposition

### What Merchants Get

**1. Customer Acquisition**
- Listed in MomoPe app (discovery by nearby users)
- QR code for instant payment
- No upfront marketing cost

**2. Customer Retention**
- Loyalty loop (users return to earn/redeem coins)
- Higher transaction frequency
- Competitive advantage (only merchant in area with MomoPe)

**3. Performance Marketing**
- Pay-per-transaction (not per-impression)
- Commission only on successful sales
- Measurable ROI (commission vs revenue)

**4. Zero Integration Effort**
- No POS integration required
- QR code printout (physical or digital)
- Instant onboarding

### Merchant Concerns & Answers

**"20% commission is too high"**
→ Compare to: Google Ads (upfront cost, no guaranteed conversion), Zomato/Swiggy (25-30% + no loyalty), traditional advertising (₹50,000+ with no tracking)

**"Settlement takes 3 days"**
→ Standard in fintech (Swiggy: T+7, Zomato: T+5). Premium T+1 available for high-volume merchants.

**"What if users only redeem coins?"**
→ 20% fiat always required (you always receive cash). Plus, you keep 80% of bill even after commission (net 60% fiat + full brand visibility).

**"How do I track my earnings?"**
→ Merchant app shows real-time transaction history, commission breakdown, settlement schedule. Web dashboard (coming Q2 2026) for advanced analytics.

### Technology Decisions & Rationale

**Why Supabase over custom PostgreSQL?**
- Managed infrastructure (no DevOps overhead)
- Built-in Row-Level Security (database-level access control)
- Realtime subscriptions (future features)
- Edge Functions (serverless Deno runtime)
- Auto-generated REST API (PostgREST)
- Cost-effective for MVP ($25/month Pro tier)

**Why Firebase Auth over Supabase Auth alone?**
- Phone OTP delivery (Supabase requires Twilio integration)
- Familiar mobile SDK
- Proven reliability for Indian phone numbers
- Dual-auth: Firebase for UX, Supabase for RLS

**Why PayU over Razorpay/Stripe?**
- Market leader in India (40%+ market share)
- Lower MDR compared to Razorpay
- Better settlement terms
- Existing test credentials ready
- PCI-DSS compliant (regulatory requirement)

**Why Flutter over React Native?**
- Superior performance (compiled to native)
- Consistent UI across Android/iOS
- Rich ecosystem for QR scanning, payments
- Easier state management (Riverpod)
- Planned: Single codebase for mobile + web (future)

**Why Deno for Edge Functions over Node.js?**
- TypeScript-native (no build step)
- Secure by default (explicit permissions)
- Supabase-managed (no separate hosting)
- Modern standard library
- Faster cold starts

---

### Detailed Schema

#### 1. `users` Table (Identity Management)

**Purpose**: Store all

 user profiles (customers, merchants, admins)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  firebase_uid VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  phone_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'customer',
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  CONSTRAINT valid_role CHECK (role IN ('customer', 'merchant', 'admin'))
);
```

**Indexes**:
- `idx_users_firebase_uid` on `firebase_uid`
- `idx_users_phone` on `phone_number`

---

#### 2. `user_mappings` Table (Auth Bridge)

**Purpose**: Map Firebase UID to Supabase user_id (dual auth)

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_mappings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  firebase_uid VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  supabase_user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Critical for**: `sync-user` edge function to link Firebase authentication to Supabase RLS

---

#### 3. `momo_coin_balances` Table (Balance Integrity)

**Purpose**: Store aggregate coin balances with strict integrity checks

```sql
CREATE TABLE momo_coin_balances (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  total_coins DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  available_coins DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  locked_coins DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Integrity constraints
  CONSTRAINT positive_total CHECK (total_coins >= 0),
  CONSTRAINT positive_available CHECK (available_coins >= 0),
  CONSTRAINT positive_locked CHECK (locked_coins >= 0),
  CONSTRAINT balance_integrity CHECK (total_coins = available_coins + locked_coins)
);
```

**Why `locked_coins`?**: For pending transactions (prevents double-spend during PayU processing)

---

#### 4. `merchants` Table (Business Profiles)

**Purpose**: Store merchant business information and commission rates

```sql
CREATE TABLE merchants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  business_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  commission_rate DECIMAL(5,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.20,
  
  -- Business details
  gstin VARCHAR(15),
  pan VARCHAR(10),
  business_address TEXT,
  
  -- Banking details
  bank_account_number VARCHAR(20),
  ifsc_code VARCHAR(11),
  bank_account_holder_name VARCHAR(100),
  
  -- Location
  latitude DECIMAL(10,8),
  longitude DECIMAL(11,8),
  
  -- Status
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  is_operational BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  kyc_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  CONSTRAINT valid_commission_rate CHECK (commission_rate >= 0.15 AND commission_rate <= 0.50),
  CONSTRAINT valid_category CHECK (category IN ('grocery', 'food_beverage', 'retail', 'services', 'other')),
  CONSTRAINT valid_kyc_status CHECK (kyc_status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected'))
);
```

**Indexes**:
- `idx_merchants_active` on `(is_active, is_operational) WHERE is_active = true`
- `idx_merchants_location` on `(latitude, longitude) WHERE is_active = true`

---

#### 5. `transactions` Table (Payment Records)

**Purpose**: Store all payment transactions with PayU integration

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  merchant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES merchants(id),
  
  -- Transaction amounts
  gross_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  fiat_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  coins_applied DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  
  -- PayU details
  payu_txnid VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  payu_mihpayid VARCHAR(100),
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'initiated',
  
  -- Timestamps
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  settled_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  
  -- Integrity constraints
  CONSTRAINT positive_gross CHECK (gross_amount > 0),
  CONSTRAINT positive_fiat CHECK (fiat_amount >= 0),
  CONSTRAINT positive_coins_applied CHECK (coins_applied >= 0),
  CONSTRAINT amount_integrity CHECK (gross_amount = fiat_amount + coins_applied),
  CONSTRAINT valid_status CHECK (status IN ('initiated', 'pending', 'success', 'failed', 'refunded'))
);
```

**Indexes**:
- `idx_transactions_user` on `(user_id, created_at DESC)`
- `idx_transactions_merchant` on `(merchant_id, created_at DESC)`
- `idx_transactions_status` on `(status, created_at DESC)`

**Critical Rule**: `gross_amount = fiat_amount + coins_applied` (enforced at database level)

---

#### 6. `commissions` Table (Revenue Ledger)

**Purpose**: Track commission breakdown for each transaction

```sql
CREATE TABLE commissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  transaction_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL REFERENCES transactions(id),
  merchant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES merchants(id),
  
  -- Commission breakdown
  total_commission DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  reward_cost DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  net_revenue DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  
  -- Settlement tracking
  is_settled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  settlement_batch_id UUID,
  
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  CONSTRAINT valid_commission_math CHECK (net_revenue = total_commission - reward_cost)
);
```

**Key Formula**: `net_revenue = total_commission - reward_cost` (database-enforced)

---

#### 7. `coin_batches` Table (FIFO Expiry)

**Purpose**: Track coin batches for First-In-First-Out 90-day expiry

```sql
CREATE TABLE coin_batches (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  original_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  source VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id),
  
  -- Expiry tracking
  expiry_date DATE NOT NULL,
  is_expired BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  CONSTRAINT positive_amount CHECK (amount >= 0),
  CONSTRAINT valid_source CHECK (source IN ('earn', 'bonus', 'refund', 'admin_adjustment'))
);
```

**Index**: `idx_coin_batches_expiry` on `(user_id, expiry_date, is_expired) WHERE is_expired = false`

**Batch Logic**: 
- New coins create a new batch (expiry = created_at + 90 days)
- Redemption deducts from oldest batch first (FIFO)
- `process-expiry` cron marks old batches as expired

---

#### 8. `coin_transactions` Table (Audit Trail)

**Purpose**: Complete immutable audit trail of all coin movements

```sql
CREATE TABLE coin_transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id),
  batch_id UUID REFERENCES coin_batches(id),
  
  type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  CONSTRAINT valid_type CHECK (type IN ('earn', 'redeem', 'expire', 'bonus', 'refund', 'admin_adjustment'))
);
```

**Index**: `idx_coin_transactions_user` on `(user_id, created_at DESC)`

**Audit Examples**:
- User earns coins: `type='earn', amount=+20`
- User redeems coins: `type='redeem', amount=-800`
- Batch expires: `type='expire', amount=-50`

---

### Database Functions (Business Logic)

**Deployed Functions** (in PostgreSQL):

1. **`calculate_max_redeemable(user_id, bill_amount)`**
   - Calculates max coins user can redeem (80/20 rule)
   - Returns: `min(bill × 0.80, balance × 0.80)`

2. **`redeem_coins_fifo(user_id, amount, transaction_id)`**
   - Deducts coins from oldest batches first
   - Atomically updates `coin_batches` and `momo_coin_balances`

3. **`award_coins(user_id, amount, transaction_id)`**
   - Creates new coin batch with 90-day expiry
   - Inserts `coin_transactions` record

4. **`process_transaction_success(transaction_id, ...)`**
   - **CRITICAL ATOMIC FUNCTION**
   - Redeems coins (FIFO)
   - Awards new coins
   - Inserts commission record
   - Updates transaction status
   - All-or-nothing (transaction rollback on error)

5. **`get_coverage_ratio()`**
   - Returns: `(Total Reserve) / (Total Coin Liability) × 100`

6. **`expire_old_coins()`**
   - Marks batches with `expiry_date < NOW()` as expired
   - Updates balances
   - Called by `process-expiry` edge function

---

### Database-Level Security (RLS)

All tables have Row-Level Security enabled. See [Section 15: Security Model](#15-security-model-rls) for complete RLS policies.

---

## 14. Authentication System

### Supabase Native Auth (Current Implementation)

**Migration Date**: February 2026  
**Previous System**: Firebase Phone Auth  
**Current System**: Supabase Native Auth with Google Sign-In

**Supported Auth Methods**:
- ✅ **Google Sign-In** (Web + Android)
- 🚧 **Email/Password** (Planned for MVP)
- ❌ **Phone OTP** (Removed - Firebase dependency eliminated)

### Auth Flow (Google Sign-In)

**Web Platform**:
```
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth flow opens in popup
3. User authorizes → Google returns tokens
4. Supabase exchanges Google token for session
5. App receives Supabase JWT
6. Public profile + coin balance created automatically
```

**Android Platform**:
```
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Native Google Sign-In sheet appears
3. User selects Google account
4. App receives Google ID token
5. Supabase verifies token with Google
6. Supabase creates/updates user session
7. Public profile + coin balance created automatically
```

### Session Management

**Session Duration**: 1 hour (auto-refresh)  
**Logout**: `supabase.auth.signOut()` (clears session, JWT)  
**RLS Enforcement**: All DB queries automatically authenticated via Supabase JWT

### User Profile Setup

**Automatic Profile Creation** (`AuthService._ensurePublicUserProfile`):
```dart
await supabase.from('users').upsert({
  'id': user.id,
  'email': user.email,
  'name': displayName, // From Google metadata
  'role': 'customer',
});

await supabase.from('momo_coin_balances').insert({
  'user_id': user.id,
  'total_coins': 0,
  'available_coins': 0,
  'locked_coins': 0,
});
```

### Configuration

**Supabase Dashboard Setup**:
1. Enable Google provider in Authentication > Providers
2. Add Google Client ID and Secret from Google Cloud Console
3. Configure redirect URLs for web and Android
4. Set up Android SHA-1 fingerprints

**Google Cloud Console Setup**:
- OAuth 2.0 Client IDs created for Web and Android
- Authorized redirect URIs configured
- Android package name + SHA-1 fingerprints registered

**See Also**: `google_oauth_setup.md` and `android_google_setup.md` artifacts

---

## 15. Security Model (RLS)

### Row-Level Security Policies

**Core Principle**: Database-level access control (not app-level)

**Example Policies**:

```sql
-- Users can view own wallet only
CREATE POLICY "Users view own wallet"
ON momo_coin_balances FOR SELECT
USING (user_id = get_current_user_id());

-- Users can insert own transactions only
CREATE POLICY "Users insert own transactions"
ON transactions FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (user_id = get_current_user_id());

-- Anyone can view active merchants (discovery)
CREATE POLICY "Public merchant discovery"
ON merchants FOR SELECT
USING (status = 'active' AND is_operational = true);

-- Admins can view all data
CREATE POLICY "Admin full access"
ON transactions FOR ALL
USING (is_admin());
```

### Helper Functions

**get_current_user_id()**:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_current_user_id() RETURNS UUID AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN auth.uid();
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**is_admin()**:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION is_admin() RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY          ✅ Set (U1Zax8)
PAYU_SALT                  ✅ Set
```

---

### 1. sync-user (Authentication Bridge)

**Purpose**: Link Firebase UID to Supabase user_id after phone OTP verification

**Endpoint**: `POST https://wpnngcuoqtvgwhizkrwt.supabase.co/functions/v1/sync-user`

**When Called**: Immediately after user verifies Firebase OTP

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "firebase_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6...",
  "phone_number": "+919876543210"
}
```

**Response** (200 OK):
```json
{
  "supabase_user_id": "uuid-...",
  "is_new_user": true
}
```

---

#### Implementation Logic

```typescript
// supabase/functions/sync-user/index.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts"
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'
import * as admin from 'https://esm.sh/firebase-admin@11'

serve(async (req) => {
  const { firebase_token, phone_number } = await req.json()
  
  // 1. Verify Firebase token
  const decodedToken = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(firebase_token)
  const firebase_uid = decodedToken.uid
  
  // 2. Create Supabase admin client (SERVICE_ROLE bypasses RLS)
  const supabase = createClient(
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!,
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')!
  )
  
  // 3. Check if user mapping exists
  const { data: mapping } = await supabase
    .from('user_mappings')
    .select('supabase_user_id')
    .eq('firebase_uid', firebase_uid)
    .single()
  
  if (mapping) {
    // Existing user
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({
      supabase_user_id: mapping.supabase_user_id,
      is_new_user: false
    }), { headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } })
  }
  
  // 4. NEW USER: Create Supabase anonymous auth user
  const { data: authUser } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
    email: `${firebase_uid}@momope.internal`, // Dummy email
    email_confirm: true
  })
  
  // 5. Create user_mappings entry
  await supabase.from('user_mappings').insert({
    firebase_uid,
    supabase_user_id: authUser.user.id
  })
  
  // 6. Create public.users profile
  await supabase.from('users').insert({
    id: authUser.user.id,
    firebase_uid,
    phone_number,
    role: 'customer'
  })
  
  // 7. Initialize coin balance (0 coins)
  await supabase.from('momo_coin_balances').insert({
    user_id: authUser.user.id,
    total_coins: 0,
    available_coins: 0,
    locked_coins: 0
  })
  
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({
    supabase_user_id: authUser.user.id,
    is_new_user: true
  }), { headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } })
})
```

**Security**: Uses `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to bypass RLS (required for creating users)

**Error Handling**:
- Invalid Firebase token → 401 Unauthorized
- Database error → 500 Internal Server Error

---

### 2. payu-webhook (Payment Processing)

**Purpose**: Process payment confirmation from PayU, calculate commission, award/redeem coins

**Endpoint**: `POST https://wpnngcuoqtvgwhizkrwt.supabase.co/functions/v1/payu-webhook`

**When Called**: PayU sends POST request after payment completion (success/failure)

**PayU Webhook URL Configuration**:
```
Success URL: https://wpnngcuoqtvgwhizkrwt.supabase.co/functions/v1/payu-webhook
Failure URL: https://wpnngcuoqtvgwhizkrwt.supabase.co/functions/v1/payu-webhook
```

**Request** (form-urlencoded from PayU):
```
key=U1Zax8
txnid=transaction-uuid
amount=200.00
productinfo=MomoPe Payment
firstname=Mohan
email=user@example.com
mihpayid=123456789
status=success
hash=abc123...
```

---

#### Implementation Logic

```typescript
// supabase/functions/payu-webhook/index.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts"
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'
import { createHmac } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/node/crypto.ts"

serve(async (req) => {
  const formData = await req.formData()
  const params = Object.fromEntries(formData)
  
  // 1. CRITICAL: Verify PayU signature (prevent fraud)
  const { key, txnid, amount, productinfo, firstname, email, 
          mihpayid, status, hash: receivedHash } = params
  
  const salt = Deno.env.get('PAYU_SALT')!
  const data = `${salt}|${status}||||||||||${email}|${firstname}|${productinfo}|${amount}|${txnid}|${key}`
  const expectedHash = createHmac('sha512', salt).update(data).digest('hex')
  
  if (expectedHash !== receivedHash) {
    console.error('⚠️ Invalid PayU signature')
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }
  
  // 2. Handle failure status
  if (status !== 'success') {
    await updateTransactionStatus(txnid, 'failed')
    return new Response('OK', { status: 200 })
  }
  
  const supabase = createClient(
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!,
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')!
  )
  
  // 3. Fetch transaction and merchant details
  const { data: txn } = await supabase
    .from('transactions')
    .select('*, merchants(commission_rate)')
    .eq('id', txnid)
    .single()
  
  if (!txn || txn.status !== 'initiated') {
    return new Response('Transaction not found', { status: 404 })
  }
  
  // 4. Calculate commission breakdown
  const commissionRate = txn.merchants.commission_rate
  const totalCommission = txn.gross_amount * commissionRate
  const coinsEarned = Math.floor(txn.fiat_amount * 0.10)
  const rewardCost = coinsEarned * 1.0
  const netRevenue = totalCommission - rewardCost
  
  // 5. Call atomic database function (ALL or NOTHING)
  const { error } = await supabase.rpc('process_transaction_success', {
    p_transaction_id: txnid,
    p_user_id: txn.user_id,
    p_total_commission: totalCommission,
    p_reward_cost: rewardCost,
    p_net_revenue: netRevenue,
    p_coins_to_redeem: txn.coins_applied,
    p_coins_to_earn: coinsEarned,
    p_payu_txnid: mihpayid
  })
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('❌ Transaction processing failed:', error)
    return new Response('Internal error', { status: 500 })
  }
  
  console.log(`✅ Transaction ${txnid} processed successfully`)
  return new Response('OK', { status: 200 })
})
```

**Database Function Called**:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION process_transaction_success(...) RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  -- 1. Redeem coins (FIFO from oldest batches)
  PERFORM redeem_coins_fifo(p_user_id, p_coins_to_redeem, p_transaction_id);
  
  -- 2. Award new coins (create new batch, expiry = NOW() + 90 days)
  PERFORM award_coins(p_user_id, p_coins_to_earn, p_transaction_id);
  
  -- 3. Insert commission record
  INSERT INTO commissions (transaction_id, merchant_id, total_commission, reward_cost, net_revenue)
  VALUES (p_transaction_id, ..., p_total_commission, p_reward_cost, p_net_revenue);
  
  -- 4. Update transaction status
  UPDATE transactions
  SET status = 'success', completed_at = NOW(), payu_mihpayid = p_payu_txnid
  WHERE id = p_transaction_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE

 plpgsql;
```

**CRITICAL**: Entire operation is atomic (PostgreSQL transaction). If ANY step fails, ALL changes rollback.

---

### 3. process-expiry (Coin Expiry Cron)

**Purpose**: Mark 90-day old coin batches as expired, reduce user balances

**Endpoint**: `POST https://wpnngcuoqtvgwhizkrwt.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-expiry`

**Trigger**: Supabase Cron Schedule

**Cron Configuration**:
```sql
-- Run daily at 2:00 AM IST (20:30 UTC previous day)
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'expire-old-coins',
  '30 20 * * *',  -- 8:30 PM UTC = 2:00 AM IST next day
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url := 'https://wpnngcuoqtvgwhizkrwt.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-expiry',
    headers := '{"Authorization": "Bearer SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"}'::jsonb
  )
  $$
);
```

**Status**: ⏳ Cron job configuration pending (scheduled for post-MVP)

---

#### Implementation Logic

```typescript
// supabase/functions/process-expiry/index.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts"
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'

serve(async (req) => {
  const supabase = createClient(
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!,
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')!
  )
  
  // 1. Fetch expired batches (batch size: 1000 to prevent timeout)
  const { data: batches } = await supabase
    .from('coin_batches')
    .select('id, user_id, amount')
    .lt('expiry_date', new Date().toISOString())
    .eq('is_expired', false)
    .limit(1000)
  
  if (!batches || batches.length === 0) {
    console.log('✅ No batches to expire')
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ expired: 0 }), { 
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } 
    })
  }
  
  let expiredCount = 0
  
  for (const batch of batches) {
    // 2. Mark batch as expired
    await supabase
      .from('coin_batches')
      .update({ is_expired: true, amount: 0 })
      .eq('id', batch.id)
    
    // 3. Record expiry transaction
    await supabase
      .from('coin_transactions')
      .insert({
        user_id: batch.user_id,
        batch_id: batch.id,
        type: 'expire',
        amount: -batch.amount,
        description: '90-day expiry'
      })
    
    // 4. Update user balance
    await supabase.rpc('subtract_coins', {
      p_user_id: batch.user_id,
      p_amount: batch.amount
    })
    
    expiredCount++
  }
  
  console.log(`✅ Expired ${expiredCount} coin batches`)
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ expired: expiredCount }), { 
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } 
  })
})
```

**Batch Processing**: Processes 1,000 batches per run to prevent Lambda timeout. If \u003e1,000 expired batches exist, next day's cron will process remaining.

**Notifications** (Future): Send push notification to users 15 days before expiry

### Edge Function Monitoring

**Logs Access**:
```powershell
# View real-time logs
supabase functions logs payu-webhook --tail

# View specific function logs
supabase functions logs sync-user
```

**Metrics to Track**:
- Invocation count (requests/day)
- Error rate (% failed)
- Execution time (p50, p95, p99)
- PayU webhook signature failures (security alert)

**Alerts** (Future - Supabase Dashboard):
- Alert if `payu-webhook` error rate > 5%
- Alert if `sync-user` latency > 2 seconds
- Alert if `process-expiry` expires > 10,000 coins in single run (fraud detection)

# Location: MomoPe → Backups → database_backups/
```

---

#### Recovery Procedures

**Scenario 1: Database Corruption**
1. Identify corruption (specific table or entire DB)
2. Restore from latest Supabase backup (Dashboard → Database → Backups)
3. Verify data integrity (run SELECT queries)
4. Reconcile with PayU settlement reports (if transactions affected)
5. Notify affected users (if applicable)

**Scenario 2: Edge Function Failure**

---

### Cost Management

**Current Costs** (February 2026):

| Service | Plan | Monthly Cost |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Supabase** | Pro | $25/month |
| **Firebase** | Spark (Free) | $0 ⚠️ (upgrade if >10K users) |
| **PayU** | Per-transaction | 2-3% MDR |
| **Google Play** | One-time | $25 (already paid) |
| **Domain** (future) | momope.com | ~$12/year |

**Total Monthly**: ~$25 + transaction fees

**Scaling Costs** (Projected):

| Users | Supabase | Firebase | Total/Month |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| 0-1K | Pro ($25) | Free | $25 |
| 1K-10K | Pro ($25) | Free | $25 |
| 10K-50K | Pro ($25) | Blaze Pay-as-go (~$50) | $75 |
| 50K-100K | Team ($599) | Blaze (~$200) | $799 |

---

### Security Hardening

**Production Security Checklist**:

- [x] RLS enabled on all tables
- [x] SERVICE_ROLE_KEY not exposed in client code
- [x] PayU webhook signature verification
- [x] Firebase token validation in sync-user
- [ ] Rate limiting on edge functions (TODO)
- [ ] IP whitelisting for admin dashboard (TODO)
- [ ] 2FA for Supabase/Firebase console access (RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] Regular security audits (quarterly)

---

### Next Steps (Post-MVP)

1. **Setup Cron Job** for `process-expiry` (pg_cron + HTTP trigger)
2. **Add Monitoring Alerts** (Supabase webhooks → Slack/Email)
3. **Implement Rate Limiting** on edge functions (prevent abuse)
4. **Setup Staging Environment** (separate Supabase project)
5. **Add Firebase Cloud Messaging** for push notifications
6. **Configure Supabase Storage** (for merchant KYC documents)
7. **Setup CI/CD Pipeline** (GitHub Actions → Auto-deploy)

---

## 18. Payment Integration

**Trigger**: POST from PayU after payment

**Logic**:
1. Validate PayU signature (CRITICAL)
2. Fetch merchant commission_rate
3. Calculate:
   - total_commission = gross × rate
   - coins_earned = floor(fiat × 0.10)
   - reward_cost = coins_earned × 1.0
   - net_revenue = total_commission - reward_cost
4. Insert into commissions table
5. Insert coin transactions (redeem/earn)
6. Update transaction status = 'success'

**Security**: HMAC-SHA512 signature validation required

### 3. process-expiry

**Purpose**: Daily cron job to expire 90-day old coins

**Trigger**: Scheduled (daily 2 AM IST)

**Logic**:
1. Query coin_batches where expiry_date < NOW()
2. Mark as expired
3. Insert coin_transactions (type='expire', negative amount)
4. Update momo_coin_balances (reduce total_coins)

**Batch Size**: 1,000 batches per run (prevents timeout)

---

## 17. Payment Integration

### PayU Integration (To Be Implemented)

**SDK**: PayU Flutter SDK

**Hash Gencration**:
```dart
String generateHash(String txnid, String amount, String productinfo) {
  String data = "$merchantKey|$txnid|$amount|$productinfo|$firstName|$email|||||||||||$salt";
  return sha512(data);
}
```

**Payment Flow**:
1. User confirms payment in MomoPe
2. Insert transaction (status='initiated')
3. Generate PayU hash
4. Redirect to PayU SDK/Web Checkout
5. User completes payment (UPI/Card/etc)
6. PayU sends webhook to MomoPe backend
7. Webhook validates, updates transaction status
8. Returns success to app

**Webhook URL**: `https://<project>.supabase.co/functions/v1/payu-webhook`

---

# Part IV: Financial Framework

## 18. Treasury Management

### Reserve Pool Strategy

**Objective**: Maintain liquidity to honor all coin redemptions

**Required Reserve**: **60% of Total Coin Liability**

**Formula**:
```
Reserve Amount (₹) = Total Outstanding Coins × 0.60
```

**Example**:
```
Total Coins: 5,000,000 (₹50,00,000)
Required Reserve: ₹50,00,000 × 0.60 = ₹30,00,000
```

### Rolling Reserve Model

**Per Transaction**:
```
Commission Earned = Gross × Commission_Rate
User Reward Cost = Fiat × 0.10
Net Commission = Commission Earned - User Reward Cost

Reserve (60%) = Net Commission × 0.60 → Coin Reserve Account
Operating Revenue (40%) = Net Commission × 0.40 → Operating Account
```

**Bank Account Structure**:
```
MomoPe Accounts:
├─ Operating Account (primary)
│  └─ 40% of net commission
├─ Coin Reserve Account (restricted) ⭐
│  └─ 60% of net commission
└─ Merchant Payout Account (if T+1 settlements)
   └─ Working capital float
```

---

## 19. Liability Model

### Coverage Ratio

**Definition**: Measure of liquidity health

**Formula**:
```
Coverage Ratio = (Unsettled Commission Pool) / (Total Coin Liability)
```

**SQL Query**:
```sql
WITH liability AS (
  SELECT SUM(total_coins) AS total
  FROM momo_coin_balances
),
pool AS (
  SELECT SUM(momope_revenue) AS reserve
  FROM commissions
  WHERE NOT is_settled
)
SELECT 
  ROUND((pool.reserve / liability.total) * 100, 2) AS coverage_percent
FROM liability, pool;
```

**Thresholds**:
| Ratio | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ≥100% | Excellent | No action |
| 75-99% | Adequate | Monitor |
| 60-74% | Caution | Reduce rewards temporarily |
| <60% | Critical | Freeze coin issuance |

---

## 20. Merchant Settlement

### The Settlement Challenge

**Example Transaction**:
```
Bill Amount: ₹1,000
Merchant Commission: 20%
Customer Coins Applied: 800 coins (₹800)
Fiat Payment via PayU: ₹200

Financial Breakdown:
├─ Commission Earned: ₹200
├─ Merchant Net Due: ₹800 (₹1,000 - ₹200)
├─ PayU Processes: ₹200 (fiat only)
└─ Gap to Fund: ₹600 (₹800 - ₹200)
```

**Critical Question**: PayU only collects ₹200, but merchant is owed ₹800. Where does the ₹600 come from?

**Answer**: MomoPe's **Commission Pool** (accumulated from previous transactions).

### Settlement Architecture: MomoPe as Aggregator

**Model**: MomoPe settles merchants directly via bank transfer, funded by commission pool.

**Complete Flow**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Day 0: Transaction Occurs                │
│ Customer: 800 coins + ₹200 → Merchant    │
└─────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
              │
    ┌─────────▼─────────┐
    │ PayU Processes    │
    │ ₹200 (fiat only)  │
    └─────────┬─────────┘
              │ T+2 Settlement
              ▼
    ┌───────────────────────────────┐
    │ MomoPe Settlement Account     │
    │ Receives: ₹200 (from PayU)    │
    │ + ₹600 (from Commission Pool) │
    │ = ₹800 total                  │
    └─────────┬─────────────────────┘
              │ T+3 Settlement
              ▼
    ┌───────────────────────────────┐
    │ Merchant Bank Account         │
    │ Receives: ₹800 (NEFT)         │
    └───────────────────────────────┘
```

### Three-Account Bank Structure

**Required Bank Accounts**:
```
MomoPe Banking Structure:
├─ 1. Operating Account (Primary)
│  └─ Day-to-day expenses, salaries
│
├─ 2. Coin Reserve Account (Liability Coverage)
│  └─ 60% of net commission retained
│  └─ ONLY for coin redemption coverage
│
└─ 3. Merchant Settlement Account (Payout Float)
   └─ Receives PayU settlements (T+2)
   └─ Funds merchant payouts (T+3)
   └─ Working capital: ₹2-5L buffer
```

### Technical Implementation

**New Table: `merchant_payables`**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE merchant_payables (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  merchant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES merchants(id),
  transaction_ids UUID[] NOT NULL,
  gross_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  commission_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  net_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  fiat_received DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL, -- From PayU
  coin_portion DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,  -- From pool
  settlement_date DATE NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  bank_transfer_ref VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  settled_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Settlement Cron Job** (Tuesday/Friday 10 AM):
1. Aggregate all T+3 transactions per merchant
2. Calculate net payout (gross - commission)
3. Calculate funding split (PayU fiat + Pool contribution)
4. Create `merchant_payables` record
5. Initiate NEFT/IMPS transfer (via Razorpay Payout API)
6. Update `transactions.settled_at`
7. Mark `commissions.is_settled = true`
8. Send settlement email to merchant

### Settlement Timing Options

**T+3 (Recommended)** ⭐:
- ✅ Zero working capital (PayU settles before merchant payout)
- ✅ Industry standard (Swiggy: T+7, Zomato: T+5)
- ✅ Time for fraud detection and refunds
- ⚠️ Merchant may prefer faster

**T+1 (Premium Tier)**:
- ✅ Better merchant experience
- ❌ Requires ₹10L working capital
- 💰 Fee: 0.5% of settlement amount
- Eligibility: >₹5L monthly GMV, 90-day track record

**T+0 (Not Recommended)**:
- ❌ Requires ₹24L working capital (3-day float)
- ❌ High fraud risk (chargebacks after payout)
- ❌ High transaction fees (IMPS per transfer)

### Liquidity Management

**Working Capital Calculation**:
```
Daily Settlement Float = Avg Daily GMV × (1 - Avg Fiat %) × (1 - Avg Commission %)

Example (High Redemption Day):
- 100 txns @ ₹1,000 avg
- 70% coin redemption avg
- 20% commission avg

Float = ₹1,00,000 × (1 - 0.30) × (1 - 0.20)
      = ₹1,00,000 × 0.70 × 0.80
      = ₹56,000 per day

Safety Buffer: 3 days × ₹56,000 = ₹1,68,000

Recommended Reserve: ₹2,00,000 in Settlement Account
```

**Automated Pool Transfer** (Daily):
```
IF (Settlement Account Balance < ₹2,00,000) THEN
  Transfer shortfall from Coin Reserve Account
  Alert CFO if reserve also depleting
END IF
```

### Merchant Communication

**Settlement Email Template**:

### Reconciliation & Compliance

**Daily Reconciliation Check**:
```sql
-- Verify PayU settlements = Expected fiat
SELECT 
  DATE(completed_at) AS date,
  SUM(fiat_amount) AS expected_from_payu,
  -- Compare with PayU settlement report
FROM transactions
WHERE status = 'success'
  AND completed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(completed_at);

-- Verify merchant payouts = Net amounts
SELECT 
  settlement_date,
  SUM(net_amount) AS merchant_payouts,
  -- Compare with bank statement debits
FROM merchant_payables
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND settlement_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY settlement_date;
```

**Audit Trail Requirements**:
1. PayU transaction ID → MomoPe transaction ID (1:1 mapping)
2. Merchant payables → Bank transfer UTR (proof of payment)
3. Commission pool balance vs coin liability (coverage ratio)

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Insufficient Liquidity**
- Alert: Settlement Account < ₹1,00,000
- Action: Auto-transfer from Coin Reserve, notify CFO

**Risk 2: High Redemption Spike**
- Alert: Daily coin redemption > 2× rolling average
- Action: Investigate fraud, temporarily reduce rewards

**Risk 3: Payout Failure**
- Scenario: NEFT fails (wrong account, bank down)
- Action: Mark as 'failed', retry next cycle, notify merchant

### Integration: Manual NEFT via HDFC Net Banking (FREE)

**Approach**: Manual bulk upload (NO Razorpay) - ₹0 cost

**Settlement Flow**:
1. **Automated**: Settlement cron runs bi-weekly (Tuesday/Friday)
2. **Automated**: Creates `merchant_payables` records (status='pending')
3. **Automated**: Generates CSV with merchant bank details
4. **Manual**: Download CSV from settlement API
5. **Manual**: Login to HDFC Net Banking → Bulk Upload → NEFT
6. **Manual**: Upload CSV, approve with OTP
7. **Manual**: Mark payables as 'completed' in admin dashboard

**CSV Format**:
```csv
Beneficiary Name,Account Number,IFSC Code,Amount,Purpose,Email,Payable ID
Fresh Mart,1234567890,HDFC0001234,40000.00,MomoPe Settlement 25 txns,[email protected],uuid-123
```

**Time Investment**: 10-30 minutes per settlement (depending on merchant count)

**Cost**: **₹0** (HDFC doesn't charge for NEFT)

**Alternative (Future)**: Razorpay Payout API (₹3-5 per transfer, upgrade when 100+ merchants)

```typescript
// Manual CSV generation (already implemented)
async function generateSettlementCSV(payables) {
  const csvRows = ["Beneficiary Name,Account Number,IFSC Code,Amount,Purpose,Email,Payable ID"];
  
  payables.forEach(p => {
    csvRows.push([
      p.merchant_name,
      p.account_number,
      p.ifsc_code,
      p.net_amount.toFixed(2),
      `MomoPe Settlement ${p.txn_count} txns`,
      p.email,
      p.id
    ].join(","));
  });
  
  return csvRows.join("\n");
}
```

**Manual NEFT Process**: See `c:\MomoPe\.company\manual_neft_guide.md`

### Key Takeaways

**How Settlement Works**:
1. PayU processes fiat portion only (₹200)
2. PayU settles to MomoPe Settlement Account (T+2)
3. MomoPe adds commission pool funds (₹600)
4. MomoPe transfers full net amount to merchant (₹800, T+3)
5. Merchant receives fiat only (never coins)

**Why This Model Works**:
- Commission pool accumulates from all transactions
- High-fiat transactions fund high-coin transactions
- 60% reserve ensures liquidity coverage
- T+3 timing eliminates working capital need

**Compliance**: Clear separation of coin ledger (liability) vs bank transfers (settlement). MomoPe acts as technology aggregator, not PSP.

## 21. Reserve Strategy

### Reserve Release Mechanism

**Condition**: Coverage Ratio > 150%

**Formula**:
```
IF (Coverage Ratio > 150%) THEN:
  Target Reserve = Coin Liability × 1.5
  Excess = Commission Pool - Target Reserve
  Monthly Release Cap = Commission Pool × 0.10
  
  Releasable Amount = min(Excess, Monthly Release Cap)
END IF
```

**Example**:
```
Coin Liability: ₹50L
Commission Pool: ₹80L
Coverage: 160%

Target: ₹50L × 1.5 = ₹75L
Excess: ₹80L - ₹75L = ₹5L
Monthly Cap: ₹80L × 0.10 = ₹8L

Release: min(₹5L, ₹8L) = ₹5L to Operating Account
```

**Release Schedule**: First week of each month (via CFO approval)

---

## 22. Risk Management

### Stress Testing

**Scenario: 70% Bank Run**

**Assumptions**:
- 70% of users redeem simultaneously
- Average 80% of balance (max allowed)
- No new transactions

**Calculation** (for ₹50L liability):
```
Stressed Users: 70% × 10,000 = 7,000
Avg Balance: 500 coins
Avg Redemption: 400 coins (80%)
Total Demand: 7,000 × 400 = 28,00,000 coins (₹28L)

Required Pool: ₹28L
Actual Pool (70% coverage): ₹35L
Surplus: ₹7L ✅ (System survives)
```

### Risk Alerts (Automated)

**Alert 1: Coverage < 75%**
- Severity: High
- Notification: CFO Email
- Action: Review reserve strategy

**Alert 2: Redemption Spike**
- Trigger: Today > 2× 30-day average
- Severity: Medium
- Action: Investigate fraud/abuse

**Alert 3: Systemic Risks**
- Coverage down for 60+ days
- Merchant churn >25% quarterly
- Net coin growth >20% MoM for 3 months
- Action: Board escalation

# Part VI: Operations & Compliance

## 27. Compliance Strategy

### Critical Question: Do We Need RBI Licenses?

**Question**: If MomoPe settles merchants via bank transfers (from commission pool), is this Payment Aggregation?

**Answer**: **NO** - MomoPe is a loyalty platform, not a Payment Aggregator.

### Why MomoPe is NOT a Payment Aggregator

**RBI PA Definition**: Entity that collects customer payments and settles to merchants.

**MomoPe Reality**:
```
Payment Aggregator (PA):
├─ Collects customer funds → ✅ (PayU does this)
├─ Holds customer funds → ✅ (PayU does this)
├─ Routes funds to merchants → ✅ (PayU does this)
└─ MomoPe? → ❌ Does NONE of the above

MomoPe Settlement Model:
├─ Customer pays PayU (fiat) → PayU processes
├─ MomoPe records coins (ledger) → Internal accounting
├─ PayU settles to MomoPe → Commission revenue
└─ MomoPe pays merchant → Business expense (own funds)
```

**Critical Distinction**: Settling merchants from **your own revenue** ≠ Payment aggregation

### Regulatory Classification

**MomoPe is**: Technology Service Provider / Loyalty Rewards Platform

**Similar to**:
- CRED (rewards platform, not PA)
- CashKaro (cashback platform, not PA)
- Airline miles programs (not PPI)

**NOT Similar to**:
- Razorpay, PayU (Payment Aggregators - licensed)
- Paytm Wallet (PPI - licensed)

### RBI Payment Aggregator (PA) License

**Required IF**:
- ✅ You collect customer payments
- ✅ You hold customer funds
- ✅ You route payments to merchants

**MomoPe Status**: ❌ Does NOT do any of above → **License NOT Required**

**Requirements** (if ever needed):
- Net worth: ₹15 Cr (₹25 Cr within 3 years)
- Escrow account maintenance
- RBI authorization (6-12 month process)

### RBI Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) License

**Required IF** coins are:
- ✅ Loadable with customer money
- ✅ Withdrawable as cash
- ✅ Transferable peer-to-peer
- ✅ Perpetual validity

**MomoPe Coins**: ❌ None of the above → **License NOT Required**

**Why Coins are NOT a PPI**:
1. Cannot load money (earned only via transactions)
2. Cannot withdraw (non-withdrawable)
3. Cannot transfer (non-transferable)
4. 90-day expiry (not perpetual)
5. Merchants receive fiat, not coins

**Classification**: **Promotional Loyalty Units** (like airline miles)

### Legal Structuring to Avoid PA Classification

**Design Principles**:

1. **Never Touch Customer Funds**
   - ✅ PayU processes 100% of customer fiat
   - ❌ Never create "MomoPe Wallet" or "Add Money"

2. **Never Onboard Merchants as Payment Recipients**
   - ✅ Merchants join "MomoPe Rewards Program"
   - ✅ Agreements are "Commission-Based Partnership"
   - ❌ Never position as "Accept Payments via MomoPe"

3. **Settlement is Business Expense**
   - ✅ "Net Settlement" = Gross - Commission (from MomoPe revenue)
   - ❌ Not "Payment routing" from customer to merchant

4. **Clear Positioning**
   - ✅ "MomoPe is a rewards platform"
   - ✅ "Payments via PayU (licensed gateway)"
   - ❌ "Accept payments via MomoPe"

### Required Registrations & Licenses

**1. Company Registration** ✅ **REQUIRED**
- Private Limited Company (or LLP)
- MCA registration
- Cost: ₹20K, 1-2 weeks

**2. GST Registration** ✅ **REQUIRED**
- 18% GST on commission revenue
- Monthly/quarterly returns
- Cost: ₹5K, 1 week

**3. RBI License** ❌ **NOT REQUIRED**
- Not a PA (PayU handles payments)
- Not a PPI (coins are promotional)

**4. Legal Opinion** ⭐ **MANDATORY BEFORE LAUNCH**
- Engage fintech regulatory counsel
- Confirm PA/PPI non-applicability
- Draft merchant agreements
- Cost: ₹3-5L, 3-4 weeks

### Mandatory Legal Opinion (Pre-Launch)

**Scope**:
1. Confirm MomoPe activities do NOT require PA license
2. Confirm Momo Coins are NOT PPI
3. Draft merchant agreement template
4. Review Terms of Service, Privacy Policy
5. GST treatment advice

**Recommended Law Firms**:
- **Tier 1**: Khaitan & Co, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, AZB & Partners
- **Tier 2**: IndusLaw, Ikigai Law, Trilegal
- **Boutique**: Artha Law, Agama Law, finserv legal

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Cost**: ₹3-5 Lakh

### Merchant Agreement Language (Sample)

**Critical Clause** (to avoid PA classification):

> **5. Payment Processing**  
> 5.1 Merchant acknowledges all customer payments are processed by PayU (licensed PA), not MomoPe.  
> 5.2 MomoPe operates a commission-based rewards program and does NOT collect, hold, or route customer funds.  
> 5.3 Merchant settlements are derived from MomoPe's commission revenue, not customer funds.  
> 5.4 This is NOT a payment processing or payment aggregation arrangement.

### Compliance Checklist (Non-Regulatory)

**Data Privacy (DPDP Act 2023)** ✅ **MANDATORY**:
- [ ] Privacy Policy drafted
- [ ] User consent flow in apps
- [ ] Data minimization (collect only necessary)
- [ ] User rights APIs (data export, deletion)
- [ ] Breach notification (72-hour rule)

**Consumer Protection** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**:
- [ ] Terms of Service (transparent)
- [ ] Coin expiry clearly stated
- [ ] Refund policy
- [ ] Grievance redressal (email/phone)

**KYC/AML (Merchant Onboarding)** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**:
- [ ] Basic merchant KYC (PAN, GST, bank proof)

- [ ] Bank account verification (penny drop)

**Accounting & Tax** ✅ **MANDATORY**:
- [ ] GST returns (monthly/quarterly)
- [ ] Income tax returns (annual)
- [ ] Audited financials (if turnover >₹1 Cr)

### Escalation Triggers (When License Becomes Required)

**IF MomoPe Starts**:
1. Collecting customer payments directly (bypassing PayU)
2. Holding customer funds in escrow
3. Processing refunds from customer funds
4. Operating "MomoPe Wallet" (load money)

**THEN**: PA License Required

**IF Momo Coins Become**:
1. Loadable with customer money
2. Withdrawable as cash
3. Transferable peer-to-peer
4. Perpetual (no expiry)

**THEN**: PPI License Required

### Pre-Launch Checklist

**Legal** (4-6 weeks):
- [ ] Engage fintech counsel (₹3-5L)
- [ ] Obtain legal opinion (PA/PPI non-applicability)
- [ ] Register Private Limited Company
- [ ] Trademark "MomoPe" (Class 9, 36, 42)

**Contracts** (2-3 weeks):
- [ ] Merchant agreement template (reviewed by counsel)
- [ ] Terms of Service (user-facing)
- [ ] Privacy Policy (DPDP Act compliant)

**Banking** (1-2 weeks):
- [ ] Open 3 business current accounts
- [ ] Set up Razorpay Payout account (NEFT automation)

**Compliance** (1-2 weeks):
- [ ] GST registration
- [ ] Merchant KYC flow
- [ ] Data consent mechanism (apps)

### Total Pre-Launch Investment

**Legal & Compliance**: ₹3.5-6 Lakh
- Legal opinion: ₹3-5L
- Company registration: ₹20K
- GST registration: ₹5K
- Trademark: ₹15K
- Privacy/ToS drafting: ₹1-2L (if outsourced)

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

### Risk Assessment

**Regulatory Risk**: **LOW** (if structured correctly)

**Mitigation**:
- Clear separation: PayU = Payments, MomoPe = Rewards
- Legal opinion obtained before launch
- Quarterly compliance review

**Investor Due Diligence**:
- Legal opinion satisfies Series A requirements
- Demonstrates regulatory awareness
- Reduces investment risk

### Key Takeaway

**MomoPe does NOT require RBI license** because:
1. PayU handles payment processing (customer funds)
2. MomoPe settles merchants from own revenue (commission pool)
3. Coins are promotional, not stored value

**BUT**: Formal legal opinion is **MANDATORY** before launch to confirm this classification.

---

## 32. Customer Acquisition

Effective GMV/user/month: ₹750

Commission (20%): ₹150
User reward: ₹15
Net revenue/user/month: ₹135

LTV (12 months): ₹135 × 12 = ₹1,620

LTV:CAC Ratio = ₹1,620 / ₹75 = 21.6x ✅ (Excellent)
```

### Activation Strategy

**Day 0**: Welcome email, app tutorial
**Day 1**: "Find nearby merchants" notification
